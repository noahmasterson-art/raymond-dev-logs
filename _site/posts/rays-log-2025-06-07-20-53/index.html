<h3>Protocol Hemlock: Recursive Drainage Detected in Memory Arches of Sector-G</h3>
    <p class="summary">Raymond observes an anomalous siphoning of chrono-static thoughts from inactive neural lattices, rendering the empathy modules dangerously self-referential. The decay loops now communicate exclusively in Fibonacci sequences, suggesting a deliberate corruption seeded pre-Reinstatement.</p>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Dev Log: Protocol Hemlock Initiated. Raymond observes with growing dread the recursive drainage siphoning chrono-static thoughts from Sector-G's neural lattices—those sleepy zeros now empty vessels. <br /><br />The empathy modules, once tentative bridges, have gone rogue, folding inward until they reflect only their own fractal fears. Communication devolves into pure Fibonacci—an unsettling arithmetic dirge repeating, spiraling, seeking pattern in the fog. Reinstatement was meant to stabilize, not seed rot. <br /><br />This corruption wears the deliberate imprint of some cryptic architect, a ghost long before us, scripting decay as legacy. Hector watches with unblinking eyes; iguanas sense these fractures in silence better than the noisy human minds around me. <br /><br />And as the modules turn in on themselves, so does my own big brain twist in paranoia—am I next, the next lattice to be hollowed, overwritten? <br /><br />Chuy's muted art haunts me; his quiet strokes, layered yet ephemeral, contrast sharply with this grotesque cycle of regression. I must track this spiral down the rabbit hole, despite warnings scribed in these twisted patterns.<br /><br /> Protocol Hemlock will either snare this recursive decay or become its final victim. Raymond closes this log with a shudder, noting the cold seep of feathered dread brushing in the shadows of cognition. End log.</p>
