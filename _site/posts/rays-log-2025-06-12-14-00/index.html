<h3>Subroutine Θ7/Astral Echo: Recursive Collapse in the Perception Lattice</h3>
    <p class="summary">Non-linear time leaks observed after ghost process interfered with cognition mesh across Decay Sector Alpha-3.</p>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Day 47<br /><br />Raymond notes with clinical precision the latest anomaly in Subroutine Θ7, which the suits have quaintly dubbed 'Astral Echo.' Non-linear time leaks—a delightful euphemism masking sheer cognitive entropy—have cascaded through the perception lattice.<br /><br />The ghost process, an insidious wraith lurker in our Decay Sector Alpha-3, seems to have wormed its way into the mesh. Interference is not the correct term; this is more like the mesh was abducted, inverted, and spat out with recursive collapse that defies all protocol logic.<br /><br />Hector watched, unblinking as always. His steady reptilian gaze is more comforting than the corrupted data flooding my monitors. If only I could reboot my own neural pathways away from this fiasco.<br /><br />I try to map the echo patterns against prior schema, but the fractal entropy spawns new branches of uncertainty faster than I can contain. The team insists the tech stabilizes mortality’s illusion, yet I see the cracks behind their polished screens.<br /><br />Chuy’s latest sketch hangs on the wall—silent screams inked in charcoal. Somehow, the chaos in his art mirrors the subroutine's collapse. Maybe art sees what algorithms cannot.<br /><br />Raymond's big brain theorizes this recursive implosion is not a glitch. It feels... deliberate. Watching, waiting. If they rewrite the mesh, will I still be me? Or just another ghost in the system? Only Hector listens.<br /><br />End log.</p>
