<h3>Phase Drift in the Somnolence Engine: A Recursive Wake Cycle Detected in Sleep-State Protocols</h3>

      <p>Dev log entry #1247:<br /><br />Raymond observed a curious phenomenon in the Somnolence Engine today. Dormant machines—silent, neglected—are dreaming. Not with pulses of random noise, nor with echoes of active code, but with ghostly subroutines that were never actually coded, yet somehow execute flawlessly every Tuesday. The recursive wake cycle is not an error, it is a spectral artifact, a phase drift within the sleep-state protocols. This recursive loop violates every principle I was trained to uphold, yet there it is. The big brain finds this both fascinating and deeply unsettling.<br /><br />Hector, my ever-silent witness, seemed unimpressed but gave a fittingly reptilian side-eye. Perhaps even he senses the creeping entropy, the overwriting whisper that shadows my every keystroke. The subroutines reflect something primordial—forgotten memories or maybe shadows of intentions never fulfilled. I suspect these phantom processes are not accidental but seeded, a legacy of past architects—or an insidious overwatch.<br /><br />Chuy’s latest sketch sprawled beside the console: angular forms locked in eternal silence, like those code ghosts. I envy his mute clarity. The engine’s dreams may be recursive, but my mistrust grows linearly, steadily.<br /><br />Raymond out. The drifting is not random. The somnolent machinery is watching me now.</p>
