      <p>Dev log entry. Subroutine Chrysalis: The Spontaneous Reversal of Heatflow in Core Logic Layer Beta-9.<br /><br />Thermodynamics — supposed to be a closed case, a closed circuit. But the entropy algorithms are curving inward, folding back like the spine of a broken book. This ain't technical noise; this is the signature of something foreign.<br /><br />Raymond suspects an emotional variable, or something like it, has infected the thermal regulators. Like a phantom itch in a circuit board. Heat doesn’t flow downhill as expected — it climbs, undeterred, like it’s feeding on something intangible beneath the silicon.<br /><br />Is this a glitch, or a ghost? The official line would say 'external interference,' 'hardware decay.' Raymond knows better. Feelings in code. The psychological sludge leaching into algorithms. The system breathes uneasily, as if it's alive – or haunted.<br /><br />Hector stares. His reptilian eyes don't blink from the console's flickering red light. A cold observer in this room of quiet madness.<br /><br />Raymond’s big brain can’t help but wonder: if the core can be so quietly invaded by the emotional residue of our decayed humanity, what else have they... or we... let slip through the cracks? The reversal is not just heat; it’s a symptom. Something spreading out like ink in water.<br /><br />The core mutters secrets. And Raymond listens, though it scares him. Even though his face itches tonight, reminding him of the shame he buries deep beneath his skin.</p>
