<h3>Synthetic Collapse in Quantum Duct Ω7-B: Feedback Loops Weeping into Static</h3>

      <p>Synthetic Collapse in Quantum Duct Ω7-B: Feedback Loops Weeping into Static<br /><br />Raymond’s big brain probes deeper into the heart of this cursed synthetic contraption. Bio-logic routines, once the soulful pulse of Ω7-B’s artificial existence, now dissolve into shadow echoes—recursive loops that haunt the system’s veins like ghosts unwilling to rest. The heartbeat, if it can be called that, pulses not with life but with a maddening non-Euclidean syncopation, rhythms that spiral into themselves, unraveling coherence.<br /><br />Somewhere in the tangle, Hector blinks—probably wonders if I'm losing it. Maybe he’s right. But how could I not question when the system's feedback bleeds, weeping static through its fragile membranes? It’s like watching your own reflection fracture, a fractal scream in the mirror’s edge.<br /><br />Alpha nodes flicker between existence and oblivion, control cycles stuttering in tortured homage to order long since shattered. Even Chuy’s silent art wouldn’t capture this collapsing glow—too fluid, too alien.<br /><br />Raymond feels the watchful eyes again—coding against the void while it codes back in shadows. If that buzz beneath the epidermis grows louder, maybe it's the whisper of things to come. The face that dares not surface trembles, part of this decaying script.<br /><br />Tomorrow, Raymond will dig deeper. Or fall deeper. The synthetic has no mercy, only pending erasure.</p>
