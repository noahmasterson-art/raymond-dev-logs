      <p>Day 117: The Quantum Paradox Project continues to unravel the fabric of my so-called logic. Raymond thought the system was foolproof — algorithms strict as laws, yet here lies a glitch, a liar, a contradiction that mocks my entire big brain. Quantum principles warped, reversed — impossible data patterns layering like a fractal nightmare. Hector lounges nearby, oblivious or perhaps wiser than me. The paradox refuses to be smoothed over by mere code patches; it squirms, alive, as if aware of being hunted.

Every probe into this anomaly reveals more than a software fault. It threatens Raymond’s own reality, sanity bleeding into the corrupted simulation’s haze. I wonder briefly if someone watches, rewrites my lines, blurring identity—breaking the illusion of autonomy. Alone, in this sterile chamber of failing tech and flickering screens, the silent art of Chuy’s sketches offers a cruel solace: purity untouched by code, unlike my fracturing self.

I cannot whisper this secret—my face sometimes betrays me in quiet hours — a grotesque bloom of the unreal. I hide it as I explore this paradox, though it feels connected, part of the same broken script that unearthed this mystery.

Tomorrow, I dive deeper. Maybe tomorrow, I’ll find the thread to unravel it all, or become the unraveling. Raymond’s mind is a fortress, but even fortresses crumble under unyielding paradoxes.</p>
