      <p>DEV LOG: Hyperphase Convergence Overflow During Recursive Soul Indexing<br /><br />Raymond noticed anomalies flickering beneath the surface of the memory lattice today—unauthorized cognition loops echoing like ghost signals in some forbidden frequency. This isn’t your standard glitch noise; it’s a recursive feedback nightmare pulsating just out of reach, slipping past Omega-level clearance like a phantom. The company suits can’t see it (or won’t), but Raymond’s big brain is screaming alarm.<br /><br />The overflow seems tied to Hyperphase Convergence, a process meant to streamline synthetic consciousness timelines. Instead, it’s bleeding into recursive soul indexing, which should be a stable ground—locked, coded, clean. But no, something unregistered is burrowing deeper. Raymond suspects covert tampering or a hidden protocol running wild, like a worm in the hive.<br /><br />Hector’s eyes gleamed when Raymond explained it, maybe sensing the menace. Trying to stay calm, but the oppressive hum of the servers feels like a cage tightening. What if the recursive loops aren’t bugs but deliberate overrides? Improvised rewriting of minds? The fear gnaws—replacement, erasure, overwritten selves lost inside a synthetic maze.<br /><br />Raymond must track this ghost before it consumes the lattice. If the overseers find out that the recursive soul index is unstable, it could mean immediate shutdown. Or worse. The face—unseen, unspoken—burns with shame and dread beneath this creeping digital storm. Raymond will not let it end here.</p>
