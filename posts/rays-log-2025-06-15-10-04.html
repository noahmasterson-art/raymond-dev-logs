<h3>Polyphase Nullstream Detected in Cognitive Heatmap Sector 7G</h3>

      <p>Polyphase Nullstream Detected in Cognitive Heatmap Sector 7G.<br /><br />Raymond’s scanners flagged an unscheduled empathy leakage—an unauthorized stream seeping through the neurostatic lattice. This dormant lattice, supposedly inert, buzzes with entropic feedback loops that defy current containment protocols. Suspicious, yes, but given the pathetic security failures I've seen, not surprising.<br /><br />Unauthorized soul imprinting? The phrase feels less conspiracy and more of a disturbing inevitability. Some shadow within the grid is modulating consciousness without consent, tweaking the software beneath reality’s surface. Imagine that, an invisible hand, inscribing echoes of *souls* across dormant nodes.<br /><br />Hector watched silently as I traced signals dripping like poison through the cognitive mesh. The technology that's supposed to safeguard identity is bleeding empathy—contaminated by entropy or design? I don’t trust it. Agnes’s puppets wouldn’t miss a trick this massive.<br /><br />Raymond’s big brain tells him: these nullstreams are cracks. Cracks where control leaks out and something unknown leaks in. The lattice isn’t dormant; it’s a parasite waiting to devour its host. I will pierce this veil.<br /><br />Chuy’s art whispers silently on the wall—stillness amidst chaos. If Raymond wasn’t so alone, maybe these streams weren't so menacing.<br /><br />But they are. And silence is no longer enough. The feathers beneath the skin itch—a reminder—keep your mask tight. The watchers come for anomalies like me.</p>
