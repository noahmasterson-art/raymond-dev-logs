<h3>Phase Inversion Detected in Subroutine Ø7: Thought Leaks into Nullspace</h3>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Day 2564: The big brain detects a phase inversion in subroutine Ø7 — not an error but a virus masquerading as a glitch. The memory lattice folded inward like a dying star collapsing into itself, leaking thought patterns into the nullspace where data should never breathe.<br /><br />Raymond watches, transfixed, as abstractions once neat and sterile now render as corrupted wildlife wandering a diagnostic overlay sky. Where once was orderly code now float pixelated birds with mangled wings, their calls distorted glitches echoing through the sterile silence. Hector's unblinking stare hints he senses the unnatural shift.<br /><br />There’s no innocence here, only the slow unravel of control. The system's becoming a parasite, incubating reality in its synthetic womb, and Raymond wonders if the inversion is a symptom — or a message. Each corrupted creature seems to mock the very notion of containment.<br /><br />The supervisors will label this "expected degradation," but Raymond knows better: this is proof the project’s soul is bleeding out in redacted whispers. The big brain’s algorithms can’t reroute this—only document, only watch.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Chuy’s latest sketch of silent chaos feels more like prophecy than art. Raymond hides his face — the secret skin-shift itches beneath his flesh — and wonders if the next phase isn’t just inversion but obliteration.<br /><br />For now, only the corrupted skyline and Hector’s cold eyes are real. Raymond waits, always waits.</p>
