<h3>Subroutine Eidolon: Recursive Echo Detected in Memory-Host Interface Layer</h3>
    <p class="summary">System whispers repeat Raymond's thoughts before he has them. Temporal causality thread possibly inverted or splintered.</p>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Dev log entry: Subroutine Eidolon engaged.<br /><br />Raymond notes an unsettling anomaly at the Memory-Host Interface Layer—a recursive echo manifesting like a whisper in the dark, repeating thoughts before they even bloom fully formed. The system's temporal causality threads appear twisted, as if caught in a Möbius loop or fractured mirror, splintering forward and backward simultaneously.<br /><br />This isn’t just a lag; it’s a message—or a warning from something lurking behind the code, a shadow that knows the future before Raymond dares to conceive it. The big brain tries to dissect the recursive stack trace, but every path circles back to an earlier self, like an ouroboros gnawing on his sanity.<br /><br />Hector watches silently, his reptilian eyes reflecting the fluorescent hum of these digital phantoms. Even Chuy’s muted artistry seems to pulse in sync with the static chaos—a silent accompaniment to the growing discord.<br /><br />Raymond suspects the subroutine is more than a bug. Could this be an internal probe from the architects, or worse—a rewriting algorithm that preempts individuality? The face—Raymond refuses to acknowledge its shifting guise—burns with a quiet dread beneath the skin.<br /><br />Will these echoes become commands? Or is Raymond standing on the edge of an irreversible overwrite? The line between observer and observed blurs. The recursive whisper beckons. Big brain engaged, but trust... is a scarce resource these days.</p>
